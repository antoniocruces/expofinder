A major: new key functionalities of the application over the previous version due to the inclusion of new requirements for the system, such as the inclusion of new modules or a complete overhaul of existing ones.

B minor: significant changes in the way existing functionality is offered, correcting large system failures or new evolutionary versions significantly alter the native specs.

C revision: amending for each delivery of software made.
