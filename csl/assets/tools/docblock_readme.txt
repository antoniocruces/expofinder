This class will generate docblock outline for files/folders.

Use from command line - params:
file/folder - the file or folder you want to docblock (php files)
-r - to have it recursively go through a folder
target function - to docblock only a specific method/function name

Example:
php docblock.php target.php targetFunction
or
php docblock.php target/dir -r targetFunction
